## 🌐 About The Project

Welcome to my **Network Programming** repository! This project documents my journey in mastering Computer Networking concepts by building them from scratch using **Python**.

Instead of just reading about how the Internet works, I am building the protocols myself. I analyze the traffic using **Wireshark** to ensure deep understanding of the packet structures.
